# GitHub Workflow Fix Summary

## Issue
The GitHub workflow was failing because tests were not passing. The workflow was correctly configured to block build/publish on test failures, so we needed to fix the failing tests.

## Root Causes

### 1. DynamicArray Registration Issue
**Problem**: `DynamicArray` class was missing the required `[DynamicStructure]` attribute, causing 9 test failures.

**Solution**: 
- Added `[DynamicStructure("DynamicArray")]` attribute to the class
- Added explicit `DynamicArray.Register()` call in test constructor

**Files Changed**:
- `ntoskrnlib.Common/Structure/DynamicArray.cs` - Added attribute
- `ntoskrnlib.Tests/DynamicArrayTests.cs` - Added explicit registration call

### 2. Memory Buffer Size Issue
**Problem**: Test memory buffer was only 4096 bytes, but tests were using addresses up to 0x1200 (4608), causing 3 test failures.

**Solution**: 
- Increased memory buffer from 4096 to 8192 bytes

**Files Changed**:
- `ntoskrnlib.Tests/DynamicStructureTests.cs` - Increased buffer size

### 3. Workflow Complexity
**Problem**: Test reporter action was adding unnecessary complexity and potential failure points.

**Solution**: 
- Simplified workflow to basic test execution
- Removed `dorny/test-reporter` action
- Simplified artifact uploads (only on failure)
- Reduced permissions to minimum required

**Files Changed**:
- `.github/workflows/generate-types.yml` - Simplified test job

## Changes Made

### 1. ntoskrnlib.Common/Structure/DynamicArray.cs
```diff
  namespace ntoskrnlib.Structure
  {
+     [DynamicStructure("DynamicArray")]
      public class DynamicArray : DynamicStructure
      {
```

### 2. ntoskrnlib.Tests/DynamicArrayTests.cs
```diff
  public class DynamicArrayTests : TestFixtureBase
  {
+     public DynamicArrayTests()
+     {
+         // Explicitly ensure DynamicArray is registered
+         DynamicArray.Register();
+     }
```

### 3. ntoskrnlib.Tests/DynamicStructureTests.cs
```diff
  public DynamicStructureTests()
  {
-     _memory = new TestMemorySource(4096);
+     _memory = new TestMemorySource(8192);  // Increased from 4096 to accommodate all test addresses
  }
```

### 4. .github/workflows/generate-types.yml
```diff
- name: Run tests
- run: dotnet test ntoskrnlib.Tests/ntoskrnlib.Tests.csproj -c Release --no-build --verbosity normal --logger "trx;LogFileName=test-results.trx" --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
+ run: dotnet test ntoskrnlib.Tests/ntoskrnlib.Tests.csproj -c Release --no-build --verbosity normal

- name: Upload test results
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
- if: always()
+ if: failure()
  with:
    name: test-results
-   path: '**/test-results.trx'
+   path: |
+     **/TestResults/**/*.trx
+     **/TestResults/**/*.log

- name: Test Report
-   uses: dorny/test-reporter@v1
-   if: always()
-   with:
-     name: Test Results
-     path: '**/test-results.trx'
-     reporter: dotnet-trx
-     fail-on-error: true
```

## Test Results

### Before Fixes
- **70 out of 82 tests passing (85%)**
- 9 DynamicArray test failures
- 3 address boundary test failures

### After Fixes
- **âœ… All 82 tests passing (100%)**
- 0 failures
- Workflow now succeeds

## Workflow Behavior

The updated workflow now:
1. âœ… Runs all tests before building
2. âœ… Blocks build if tests fail
3. âœ… Blocks version generation if tests fail  
4. âœ… Blocks publishing if tests fail
5. âœ… Provides clear test output
6. âœ… Uploads artifacts only on failure (reduces storage)

## Verification

Run tests locally to verify:
```bash
dotnet test ntoskrnlib.Tests/ntoskrnlib.Tests.csproj -c Release

# Output:
# Passed!  - Failed:     0, Passed:    82, Skipped:     0, Total:    82
```

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to master
2. GitHub Actions will run the workflow
3. Tests will pass âœ…
4. Build will proceed âœ…
5. Package will be generated (if content changed) âœ…
6. Publishing will occur (if version is new) âœ…

The workflow is now production-ready with proper test gating! ðŸŽ‰

## 2025-10-24 Update: Windows build failed due to DIA step

### Symptom
- The build job failed at step "Ensure DIA (msdia140.dll) is present and registered" with conclusion=failure.
- GitHub Jobs API shows the failure in the `Build, generate, compare` job before the actual build could run.

### Root Cause
- The step treated missing `msdia140.dll` as a hard error and attempted to install Visual Studio Build Tools on the hosted runner. This is heavy and brittle, and not required for the default DbgHelp-based generation path.

### Fix
- Made DIA registration optional and non-blocking. If `msdia140.dll` is found in common Visual Studio locations, the workflow registers it. If not found, it logs a warning and proceeds.
- Removed the Build Tools installation to avoid timeouts and flakiness.

### File Changed
- `.github/workflows/generate-types.yml` â€“ replace the DIA step with a non-fatal "Attempt DIA registration (non-blocking)" step.

### Why This Is Safe
- The generator prefers DbgHelp and only falls back to DIA if needed.
- Keeping DIA optional restores the prior successful path without adding risk.

### What to Expect
- The build job should now proceed past the DIA step and continue with generation, verification, packing, and (if applicable) branch/PR creation and publish.
